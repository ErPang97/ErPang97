#### About Me:

I am an asiring software engineer. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, enrolled in the Master of Computer and Information Technology program. 
While I'm not 100% set on what specific role I'd like to have, I know I want to use my skillset to make something meaningful!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of different websites! One in particular is my Comprehensible Cebuano Website, which I'm hoping will be a useful resource for me, and for others to learn my parents' mother tongue.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Artificial Intelligence! I've just finished taking an AI class, and a Natural Language Processing class! I've also taken Network Systems which was also very interesting, and am now studying the Internet and Web Systems. On the side I'm trying to learn other technologies, like the Spring framework and SQL to further develop my skillset.
